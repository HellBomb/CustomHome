Recepticals: 
    Any/all outlets should be framed within 6 inches (closer is better) on both top and bottom to provide an effective air sealed pocket for the drywall penetration. Pocket should have edges sealed with acoustic sealant and filled with rockwool as to mazimize air barrier and sound reduction potential.
    
Wall to Concrete Connections
    Wood should never have direct contact with concrete. All connections between concrete and wood should have a EPDM gasket and edges sealed with acoustic sealant. The gasket should be as wide as the wood (4in in most instances) to provide an effective capillary break.
