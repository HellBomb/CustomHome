Wall Assembly

	Exterior wall assembly should be a multi-layered setup.
	
	1. Concrete Wall

	2. GSP 6 inch GSP insulation foam.

	3. Adhesively attached WTB

	4. Rainscreen

	5. 


Wall Penetrations.

	Exterior wall penetrations should be documented and photographed on both sides after completion.
	Wall penetration holes will be drilled at a 45 degree angle with decline angleing towards exterior elimination chance of water infultrating wall cavatiy.
	Both interior and exterior of wall will be installed in the following manner.
	
	1. Foam will be cut away from concrete allowing sealing to be done at concrete level.

	2. Appropriate quickflash product will be sealed directly to the concrete using Adiseal or equivilent product.

	3. (Cables Only) Because cables tend to have a larger gap between sealing cables, 2 pieces of tape should be used on top/bottem to form a moisture weep.

	4. Foam will be placed back over cable/conduit then sealed on all sides using appropriate sealing tape.

	5. Caulking will then be used to seal around edges of cable/conduit creating effective air/water barrier around penetration to foam protecting foam.

	6. (Conduit only) If the conduit used has any left over space, bug proof expanding foam should be used throughout entire conduit effectively sealing it.

	7. Finally, flex tape will be used over caulking as a 2nd line of defense in case caulking cracks or weakens over time.

	8. Complete! This should effectively provide
