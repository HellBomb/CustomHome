Planning
 - A proper HVAC plan will be a part of the architectural documentation and will accomodate a high-performance duct system.

Materials
 - Round sheet metal rigid duct used, minimizing flex tubing as much as possible
 - Dampers are installed at all takeoffs and accessible after insulation is installed.
 - Mastic sealant should be used on all seams, turning points, and fasteners of all ducting.
 - Return should accomodate 2in MERV 13 filter.
